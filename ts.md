# Typescript

Typescript = Javascript + **a type system**

* Helps us catch errors during development
* Uses 'type annotations' to analyse our code
* Only active during development
* Doesn't provide any performance optimization

Typescript code (Javascript with type annotations) -> Typescript Compiler -> Plain Javascript -> Browser/Node executes plain Javascript

## Typescript compiler installation: tsc

    npm install -g typescript ts-node


```typescript
   
```
